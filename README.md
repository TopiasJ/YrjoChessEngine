Point of this project was to learn about Rust programming language. 

This is initially trying to duplicate my earlier work on python and trying to have good performance. https://github.com/TopiasJ/ChessEngine (Still missing all evolutionary algrorithm stuffs). 

And maybe later it will be used to test different AI stuffs, especially Deep Learning. And could join to AI chess tournaments.
